# Example-1

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]


# Example-2

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]


# Constraints

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

# conclusion

binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii optimized solution with running time of 1 mili-seconds and 42mb memory usage
